JavaFX Layout with Panes and Event Handling - Completed March 2023


GUI application coded with JavaFX to practice implementing BorderPane layouts and event handlers. The left-most column on the GUI contains buttons for modifying the GUI shown on the right of the window in realtime. I coded in two toggles for showing/hiding a rainbow or a smiley face, as well as radio buttons to rotate the caption. The caption can also be changed by typing in the text box and clicking a button to update the GUI.
