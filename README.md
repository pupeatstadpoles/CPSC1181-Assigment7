JavaFX Layout with Panes and Event Handling - Completed March 2023


GUI application coded with JavaFX to practice implementing BorderPane layouts and event handlers. The left-most column on the GUI contains buttons for modifying the GUI shown on the right of the window in realtime. I coded in two toggles for showing/hiding a rainbow or a smiley face, as well as radio buttons to rotate the caption. The caption can also be changed by typing in the text box and clicking a button to update the GUI.

It was a little challenging trying to figure out how to align all the elements in that column for the GUI options but using VBox and HBox came in very handy once I realised it was similar to how CSS flexbox and grid works. Event handling was a bit trickier to understand, but I managed to grasp it as somewhat similar to event handling in my previous Intro to Web Development course, where you create an event listener but have to attach it to a certain element for it to work.
